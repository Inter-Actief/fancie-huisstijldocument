Ofcourse, the poster is one of the more important parts of the corporate
 identity of Inter-*Actief*. Posters are used frequently and are placed
 in places visible to both members and outsiders. Therefore it is important
 that our posters are high quality. We hope that the poster template will
 provide a good starting point for the design of Inter-*Actief* posters.

You do not need to be an expert designer to design a poster. The template
 has ben constructed to make it easy to produce a nice poster with minimal
 effort. However if you want to let loose you creativity nothing is stopping
 you. We do ask however that you leave the common elements the same
 (title, name of committee, logo, etc.). This ensures that all posters have
 at least something in common and increases recognizability.

This is how it works
--------------------
1. Download the template and open it.
2. Fill in the name of the activity, date and locations at the top.
3. Fill in the name of the committee at the bottom.
4. Find a cool picture for the background and make sure that it is AT LEAST 4 MegaPixel.
5. Save the poster as PDF and mail it to Xerox.

Tips:

* The layers (bottom right in Illustrator) contain a seperate layer for the background picture.
 If you import the picture as a layer and move it under the background layer, it will be cut to size automatically.
* Even though the template can be used with many different background images,
 we advice you to not use images with extremely light background. Also, make sure that the text at the top is still readable after inserting the background image.
